I am writing to voice safety concerns regarding the NYC subway system. On a daily basis there are delays caused by hazards such as smoke in tunnel, track fires, emergency brake activation, doors malfunctions, trains with mechanical problems, issues with switches, and loss of third rail power. These things pose serious safety threats to passengers on trains and waiting platforms. For instance, they may require passengers to wait on platforms longer than they have to and have the potential to cause overcrowding on the platforms. The NYC subway system already sees a lot of incidents where people are struck by trains. That and the consistent canceling of platform screen door implementation (see [https://www.nydailynews.com/2018/06/26/mta-holds-off-on-testing-platform-door-on-l-line/](https://www.nydailynews.com/2018/06/26/mta-holds-off-on-testing-platform-door-on-l-line/) and [https://aaronshavel.substack.com/p/what-happened-to-nycs-platform-screen](https://aaronshavel.substack.com/p/what-happened-to-nycs-platform-screen)) makes NYC subway system much more dangerous for the people that it is suppose to serve. In addition, various stations have large gaps between train and platform (see [https://abc11.com/mind-the-gap-fall-in-woman-falls-on-tracks-lirr/826245/](https://abc11.com/mind-the-gap-fall-in-woman-falls-on-tracks-lirr/826245/)). These gaps absolutely need to be reduced. 

Many of these issues I believe reflect the neglect that the state and city government as well as the MTA to prioritize maintenance, safety, and reduction in crime (such as throwing garbage onto the track, which contributes to track fires, see [https://x.com/MarkLevineNYC/status/1488161547482505226](https://x.com/MarkLevineNYC/status/1488161547482505226)). Please conduct a safety review of NYC subway system run by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) and have them correct these safety issues immediately.
